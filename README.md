# atom-win10-ui

This theme forks from [atom-community/ui-theme-template](https://github.com/atom-community/ui-theme-template) and adds an configurable accent color for tabs, buttons and some other components.
The windows 10 part is that it also has an option (enabled by default on Windows 8/10) to copy the accent color from the windows registry.
